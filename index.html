      <p>Hello!  My name is Cheryn Hunter and I am from Vancouver, WA.  I have been married to my husband for 27 1/2 years and we have 5 children, 2 daughters-in-law, and 3 grandchildren.  I love being a wife, mom and grandma!  I also like to sing, play piano, read and exercise.  Well, I don't really love to exercise, but I do enjoy the way I feel after I exercise. My favorite color is purple!</p>

      <p>Washington is a state in the Pacific Northwest.  It is very beautiful with lots of scenic hikes.  The state is called the Evergreen State because it is full of evergreen trees and is very lush and beautiful.</p>
